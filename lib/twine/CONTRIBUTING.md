# Contributing

Please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/issues) if you
have a feature you would like to add or a change you'd like to make to existing
functionality, so we can come to agreement on the change itself before you spend
time writing code. Bugfixes don't require discussion, though. We can hash things
out in the comments of your pull request as needed.

Pull requests adding code should be accompanied by [Jest unit
tests](https://jestjs.io/) where possible. Your code should also pass the `npm
run lint` task.
